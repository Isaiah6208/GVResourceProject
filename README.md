A fun little project I'm doing in my spare time to make a resource website for one of my favorite games I like to play.
This is an on-going project that currently only has child pages, I plan on adding a main parent page that will allow users to access each child page.
As I learn more I'll update this project appropriately. One big addition I plan on making to this project is to make the website scale appropriately on mobile phones.
