The first child page for my GV Resource project. 
Since the project revolves around being a resource website, I can now create child pages much easier by simply using this one as a template for the other pages.
I plan on structuring the pages so that the information is on the left side, and then a simple gif will be on the right side to strengthen the explanation for each suit's weapons. 


2/17/2018 - Version 1.0: Original page
2/18/2018 - Vesion 1.1: Added cost classification for the suit for better classification amongst the other units in the game.
