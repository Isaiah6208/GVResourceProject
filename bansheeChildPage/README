The first child page for my GV Resource project. Since the project revolves around being a resource website, I can now create child pages much easier by simply using this one as a template for the other pages. I plan on structuring the pages so that the information is on the left side, and then a simple gif will be on the right side to strengthen the explanation for each suit's weapons.
