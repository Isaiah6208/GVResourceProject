The first child page for my GV Resource project. 
Since the project revolves around being a resource website, I can now create child pages much easier by simply using this one as a template for the other pages.
I plan on structuring the pages so that the information is on the left side, and then a simple gif will be on the right side to strengthen the explanation for each suit's weapons. 


2/17/2018 - Version 1.0: Initial page (Contains one error relative to the GitHub button in "bansheeStyle.css", but compiles fine, will fix later.)

2/18/2018 - Vesion 1.1: 
- Added cost classification for the suit for better classification amongst the other units in the game.
  The color also indicates the suit's cost family, which players who see it will automatically appreciate.
- Added padding-bottom to the body tag to space out the ending of the page a little more for a better visual reception.
- Added margin spacing for the "a" tag in the "bansheeStyle.css" file to scale appropriately
- Increased the font size for the "a" tag to display much better and clearer.
- Changed the link on the "banshee.html" file to link to my main GitHub page, rather than the GVResource project directory.
- The link previously mentioned now has a blank attribute to stay on the same page, and to also open a seperate tab to my GitHub profile.
- All headers in the "bansheeStyle.css" file have been increased in size.
- Changed "Weapon Information" to "How To Use" in the "banshee.html" file for a much more simpler and cleaner look for the page.
